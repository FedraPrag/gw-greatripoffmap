people including a retired teacher, a hospitalized grocery clerk and a severely disabled woman,[2] Aeon Financial bought up vulnerable Americans&#8217; property tax debts &#8211; known as &#8220;liens&#8221; &#8211; in Iowa, Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland and Washington, DC. The company then allegedly piled on legal fees which often increased the debt several times, and gave homeowners a stark choice: pay up or lose your home.

It reported that officials in DC didn&#8217;t know who the real owners of Aeon were, and that the trail ended with Schwartz.[3] Only after the story received widespread attention, did Schwartz disclose in a letter to the editor in the Washington Post that he is a beneficial owner of the company. Schwartz wrote that &#8220;real property tax-lien investors such as Aeon Financial provide an invaluable public service by paying taxes that property owners have failed to pay&#8221;.[4]</span></p><div>&#10;&#10;<hr size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[1]</span></span></span><span> Washington Post, Debt-collecting machine, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/</a>&#10;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[2]</span></span></span><span> Washington Post, Debt-collecting machine, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/</a></span><span> </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[3]</span></span></span><span> <span>&#160;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/\">Washington Post, Debt-collecting machine, <u><span>http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/</span></u></a></span><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/08/debt-collecting-machine/\"><span>/</span></a></span><span> </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[4]</span></span></span><span> <span lang=\"EN-US\">Washington&#10;Post, DC&#8217;s property tax problem, </span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dcs-property-tax-problem/%202013/12/18/04477a70-6430-11e3-af0d-4bb80d704888_story.html\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dcs-property-tax-problem/%202013/12/18/04477a70-6430-11e3-af0d-4bb80d704888_story.html</span></a></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;"}],"name":"Aeon Financial","resource_uri":"/api/global-witness/anon-shell-companies/v1/company/57902/","usincorporated":[{"_author":[124],"i_sous":"US-DE","id":57764,"name":"Delaware"}]},{"_author":[124],"_status":0,"_transform":null,"anonymous":true,"caincorporated":[],"field_sources":[],"id":57900,"incorporated_in":[],"involvement_in_cases":[{"_author":[124],"crimetype":"democracy,other","id":57899,"name":"Anonymous companies disguised campaign contributions","story":"<p>Anonymous company ownership has been used to disguise campaign contributions and potential efforts to buy influence over the democratic process in the U.S.</p><p>During the 2012 election cycle, NBC reported that a shell company with anonymous owners made a $1 million donation to Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney PAC.

In contrast, by the time Bongo died, he was one of the richest men in the world.[3]</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bongo held bank accounts in Gabon, London, New York, Paris and Switzerland, the largest of which was under the name of Tendin Investments. [4]  Tendin Investments, a shell corporation registered in the Bahamas, held total funds ranging from about $28 million to $72 million.[5]<br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bongo himself was never charged with any wrongdoing during his lifetime. However, in November 2010, the French Supreme Court decided that a criminal complaint filed by several non-governmental organisations against Omar Bongo and his relatives should proceed and be investigated.[6]<br></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\">[1] Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Private banking\nand money laundering: a case study of opportunities and

Fasen set up the company in Cyprus, but was able to hide his ownership of it behind a trust registered in the British Virgin Islands.[2]<br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fasen was charged with fraud in 2014,[3] and convicted in 2012 of passing off South American horsemeat as German and Dutch beef.[4]</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[1] The Guardian, Horsemeat scandal linked to secret network of firms, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/horsemeat-scandal-victor-bout-firms\">http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/horsemeat-scandal-victor-bout-firms</a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[2] The Guardian, Horsemeat scandal linked to secret network of firms, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/horsemeat-scandal-victor-bout-firms\">http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/horsemeat-scandal-victor-bout-firms</a><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[3] GlobalMeat, Dutch business charged over horsemeat scandal, <a href=\"http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/Dutch-business-charged-over-horse-meat-scandal\">http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/Dutch-business-charged-over-horse-meat-scandal</a><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[4] The Guardian, Horsemeat scandal linked to secret network of firms, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/horsemeat-scandal-victor-bout-firms\">http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/horsemeat-scandal-victor-bout-firms</a></p>"}],"name":"Draap Trading","resource_uri":"/api/global-witness/anon-shell-companies/v1/company/57820/","usincorporated":[]},{"_author":[124],"_status":0,"_transform":null,"anonymous":true,"caincorporated":[],"field_sources":[],"id":57813,"incorporated_in":[{"_author":[124],"id":57766,"isoa3":"NGA","name":"Nigeria"}],"involvement_in_cases":[{"_author":[124],"crimetype":"poor-countries,business","id":57812,"name":"Nigerian oil minister awarded oil contract to himself and then sold it on for a fortune","new":false,"story":"&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chief Dan Etete was the Nigerian oil minister under the dictatorship of Sani Abacha.

Githongo, blew the whistle on a massive Kenyan corruption scandal. &#160;The scandal has become known as the &#8216;Anglo Leasing&#8217; affair, after the name of one of the anonymous companies involved. &#160;It has been written about extensively in the press[1] and covered in-depth in a book by Michaela Wrong.[2]</span><br/></p><div><div><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span>According to the World Bank,[3] over 20 government contracts were awarded in Kenya at inflated prices during the presidencies of Daniel Arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki. &#160;Several different companies were used as fronts in the fraud.[4] &#160;</span><br/></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span>Many of the contracts related to security issues, such as passport controls, security vehicles and police supplies.[5] &#160;By pretending that the contracts were for urgent national security needs, the usual processes for awarding contracts were avoided. &#160;For instance, a contract for the supply of passport and visa issuing systems, which should have cost around &#8364;6 million, was instead awarded to the anonymous company Anglo Leasing Finance, for &#8364;32 million[6]. &#160;The Kenya Anticorruption Commission stated that Anglo Leasing was a British company[7]; it turns out that it has an address in Liverpool but is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, with hidden ownership.[8]&#160;</span><br/></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span>In all, the over-priced contracts cost the Kenyan government nearly $1 billion[9], in a country where over 40% of the population live on less than $1.25 a day[10]. &#160;The case as a whole has never gone to trial in Kenya, however a Kenyan government audit report states that several of the companies involved made voluntary refunds during the investigations, with Anglo Leasing Finance returning $4.7 million.[11] &#160;None of the officials involved has been brought to justice.&#160;</span><br/></p><p

consistently ranked as one of the most corrupt.[1]<br></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\">Between 2003 and 2006, Jean Rene Duperval, a former director of international relations at Haiti Teleco, was paid almost half a million dollars in bribes.[2]<br></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\">Terra Telecommunications Corp.,[3] a Miami-based telecoms company, and Cinergy Telecommunications Inc. paid Duperval $497,331 in kickbacks in exchange for preferential calling rates, a continued telecommunications connection and to ensure a renewal of their contracts with Haiti Teleco, the sole provider of landline telephone services in Haiti.[4]  Cinergy was later found to be a paper company – non-operational with no employees and no assets of any real value.[5]<br></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\">To conceal the bribe payments, Duperval used “a cloak of shell corporations and fake invoices”,[6] including a Florida-based anonymous company called Telecom Consulting.[7]  He instructed Terra and Cinergy to forward the payments to Telecom Consulting, owned by his sister,[8] Marguerite Grandison.[9] The payments were backed up by false documents identifying them as fees for “international minutes from the

Abubakar Bagudu, a friend of the then President of Nigeria’s son Mohammed Abacha via an anonymously owned BVI company[2] that was controlled by Bagudu and the president’s son.[3]</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">U.S. prosecutors brought a case in the US courts to try to recover more than $500 million that they alleged had been embezzled by General Abacha, his son and others.[4]  The prosecutors alleged that Bagudu was assured by the Nigerian government that were the BVI company to buy the debt, the government would then buy it from them at an inflated price.[5] Indeed, the government did then go on to buy its own debt back for twice the market price,[6] defrauding the Nigerian people out of more than $282 million.[7]  According to the U.S. prosecutors, the money ended up in the pockets of Mohammed Abacha and Abubakar Bagudu.[8]<br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The U.S. court complaint further alleges that Nigeria's purchase of the debt was personally approved by President General Abacha, even though the country would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars by buying the debt at the original price on the open market.[9]<br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The case was not contested and a default judgment was awarded, meaning that the money in the various bank accounts identified in the court case was seized by the US authorities.[10]<br></p><p

well-known for human rights abuses, torture and assassinations. &#160;He was also engaged in grand-scale corruption.[1] &#160;The Chilean Supreme Court estimated that Pinochet had a secret fortune of more than $20 million, of which less than 10% could be accounted for by his official military salary.[2]&#160;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pinochet used two anonymous shell companies in the Bahamas, Ashburton Company and Althorp Investment, to hold money offshore.[3] &#160;The anonymous companies and their bank accounts were set up by Riggs bank in Washington DC. [4] &#160;The US Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that Riggs set up these companies in order &#8220;to disguise Mr Pinochet&#8217;s ownership of the account funds&#8221; [5] and concluded that the bank had &#8220;assisted Augusto Pinochet [&#8230;] to evade legal proceedings [&#8230;] despite red flags involving the source of Mr. Pinochet&#8217;s wealth, pending legal proceedings to freeze his assets, and public allegations of serious wrongdoing&#8221;.[6]</p><div>&#10;&#10;<hr size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span></span><span> US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Money&#10;laundering and foreign corruption: enforcement and effectiveness of the Patriot&#10;Act: case study involving Riggs Bank, </span><a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2\"><span>http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2</span></a><span>, page 18</span><span></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span></span><span> Jurist,&#10;referencing Chilean Supreme Court report, </span><a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/chile-high-court-releases-report-detailing-discrepancy-in-pinochet-fortune.php\"><span>http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/chile-high-court-releases-report-detailing-discrepancy-in-pinochet-fortune.php</span></a><span> </span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span> US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Money&#10;laundering and foreign corruption: enforcement and effectiveness of the Patriot&#10;Act: case study involving Riggs Bank, <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2\"><span>http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2</span></a>, page 20</p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span><span> US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Money&#10;laundering and foreign corruption: enforcement and effectiveness of the Patriot&#10;Act: case study involving Riggs Bank, </span><a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2\"><span>http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2</span></a><span>, page 19</span><span></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span></span><span> US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Money&#10;laundering and foreign corruption: enforcement and effectiveness of the Patriot&#10;Act: case study involving Riggs Bank, </span><a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2\"><span>http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2</span></a><span>, page 19</span><span></span></p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;<div>&#10;&#10;<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span></span> US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Money&#10;laundering and foreign corruption: enforcement and effectiveness of the Patriot&#10;Act: case study involving Riggs Bank, <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2\"><span>http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/ACF5F8.pdf?attempt=2</span></a>, page 7</p>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;</div>&#10;&#10;"}],"name":"Althorp Investment Co.
